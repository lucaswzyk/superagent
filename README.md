# SuperAgent - AI Development Platform

SuperAgent is a self-evolving AI development platform that operates like an intelligent society. At its core is a "God node" that interfaces with users and orchestrates a network of specialized AI agents. Each agent can spawn sub-agents when needed, creating an organic, hierarchical structure that efficiently tackles complex tasks.

## Vision

SuperAgent aims to be a self-sufficient AI development platform where you can request any type of tool or functionality, and the system will:
- Automatically design and implement the solution
- Create appropriate user interfaces
- Handle resource management and API integrations
- Debug and optimize the implementation
- Deliver a production-ready tool

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Tool Creation**: Automatically detects requirements and generates necessary components
- **Multi-Modal Support**: Handles various types of data (text, image, audio, video)
- **Intelligent Resource Management**: Smart context and token optimization
- **Interactive UI Generation**: Creates purpose-built interfaces for each tool
- **Self-Evolution**: Grows and improves based on usage and needs
- **API Integration**: Seamlessly incorporates external services and models
- **Security & Isolation**: Runs tools in isolated environments

## Project Structure

This is a monorepo using npm workspaces:

- `packages/web`: Frontend application
- `packages/server`: Backend API server
- `packages/agents`: AI agents ecosystem
  - `core`: Core agent functionality and God node
  - Various specialized agents (reflection, creative, etc.)
- `packages/shared`: Shared types and utilities
- `packages/database`: Database models and migrations

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: TypeScript & React
- **Backend**: Node.js
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Build System**: Turborepo
- **Package Management**: npm
- **AI Integration**: Various AI APIs as needed

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/superagent.git
   cd superagent
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

4. Start development servers:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Development Commands

- `npm run dev`: Start all development servers
- `npm run build`: Build all packages
- `npm run start`: Start production servers
- `npm run lint`: Run linting
- `npm test`: Run tests
- `npm run format`: Format code using Prettier

## Architecture

1. **God Node Layer**
   - User interface & request interpretation
   - Agent orchestration
   - System evolution control

2. **Agent Network**
   - Dynamic agent spawning
   - Task delegation
   - Resource negotiation
   - Inter-agent communication

3. **Resource Management**
   - Token optimization
   - GPU/CPU allocation
   - Memory management
   - Storage efficiency
